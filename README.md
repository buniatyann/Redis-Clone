# Redis Clone

**Redis Clone** is a simple, in-memory key-value store that replicates the basic functionality of the popular database system Redis. It was created from scratch in C++ with the goal of understanding how Redis and server applications work at a deep level. 
This project is a functional implementation of Redis-like commands, but not optimized for performance in the same way as the official Redis server.
